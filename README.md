**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FarheenKhan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: In my role as a Business Systems Analyst, I initiated the Linux Cluster Monitoring App project by orchestrating the deployment of CentOS-based virtual machines on the Google Cloud Platform. During the project's inception, I actively engaged in elicitation sessions with stakeholders, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their needs. This facilitated the creation of the Business Requirements Document (BRD), guiding subsequent stages of the project. Utilizing Docker, I efficiently managed and deployed a PostgreSQL database, optimizing resource utilization as per the requirements outlined in the System Requirements Document (SRD). In response to stakeholder input and thorough requirement analysis, I designed and implemented a relational database capable of storing detailed hardware specifications and real-time usage metrics. Automation was a key focus, streamlining the data collection process from each Linux node to meet project requirements. Rigorous testing of both the application and associated scripts, aligned with specified requirements, was conducted to ensure robust functionality. Additionally, I enhanced team communication and comprehension by creating a detailed cluster architecture diagram using draw.io. Throughout the project, the BRD and SRD played a crucial role in guiding decisions and ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.
